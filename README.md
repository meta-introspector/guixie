# guixie
guixie guile bootstrap for introspective self modifiying system.

the idea is to have it create itself
via rewrites via guix derivations
each instance can be seen as a self modifiying dao that can add functions
to itself, it composes itself and creates a new version of itself to build the next version in a chain.

The idea is that running versions
of it create new versions and
those results are aggregated in a p2p network that validates results with zkps
and allows for resuable binary results.
